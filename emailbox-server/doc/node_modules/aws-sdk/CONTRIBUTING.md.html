</div>
<p>We work hard to provide a high-quality and useful SDK, and we greatly value
feedback and contributions from our community. Whether it's a bug report,
new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we welcome your issues
and pull requests. Please read through this document before submitting any
issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to
effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.</p>

Filing Bug Reports
  </h2>
</div>
<p>You can file bug reports against the SDK on the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues">GitHub issues</a> page.</p>
<p>If you are filing a report for a bug or regression in the SDK, it's extremely
helpful to provide as much information as possible when opening the original
issue. This helps us reproduce and investigate the possible bug without having
to wait for this extra information to be provided. Please read the following
guidelines prior to filing a bug report.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Search through existing <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues">issues</a> to ensure that your specific issue has
not yet been reported. If it is a common issue, it is likely there is
already a bug report for your problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have tested the latest version of the SDK. Although you
may have an issue against an older version of the SDK, we cannot provide
bug fixes for old versions. It's also possible that the bug may have been
fixed in the latest release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide as much information about your environment, SDK version, and
relevant dependencies as possible. For example, let us know what version
of Node.js you are using, or if it's a browser issue, which browser you
are using. If the issue only occurs with a specific dependency loaded,
please provide that dependency name and version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a minimal test case that reproduces your issue or any error
information you related to your problem. We can provide feedback much
more quickly if we know what operations you are calling in the SDK. If
you cannot provide a full test case, provide as much code as you can
to help us diagnose the problem. Any relevant information should be provided
as well, like whether this is a persistent issue, or if it only occurs
some of the time.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Submitting Pull Requests
  </h2>
</div>
<p>We are always happy to receive code and documentation contributions to the SDK.
Please be aware of the following notes prior to opening a pull request:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The SDK is released under the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/">Apache license</a>. Any code you submit
will be released under that license. For substantial contributions, we may
ask you to sign a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement">Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not
yet available in the SDK, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any
duplication of effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherever possible, pull requests should contain tests as appropriate.
Bugfixes should contain tests that exercise the corrected behavior (i.e., the
test should fail without the bugfix and pass with it), and new features
should be accompanied by tests exercising the feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull requests that contain failing tests will not be merged until the test
failures are addressed. Pull requests that cause a significant drop in the
SDK's test coverage percentage are unlikely to be merged until tests have
been added.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Testing
  </h3>
</div>
<p>To run the tests locally, install <code>phantomjs</code>. You can do so using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>
<pre><code>brew install phantomjs
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to run all tests:</p>
<pre><code>npm test
</code></pre>
<p>To run a particular test subset e.g. just the unit tests:</p>
<pre><code>npm run unit
</code></pre>
<p>See the implementation of the <code>test</code> script in <code>package.json</code> for more options.</p>

Changelog
  </h3>
</div>
<p>We have moved to using a changelog to document changes between SDK versions instead of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/JavaScript">release notes</a>.
The release notes generally contained service client updates, and major SDK changes.
Our goal with the changelog is to document all changes made with each version of the SDK.
When submitting a pull request, please run the <code>add-change</code> script and commit the resulting JSON file so that your change gets added to the changelog.
From SDK root:</p>
<pre><code>npm run add-change
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="./scripts/changelog/README.md.html">add-change cli notes</a> for more information.</p>
